# RateYourMusic Tools

This is a set of (currently under development) Tampermonkey tools/tweaks for [RateYourMusic](https://rateyourmusic.com), an online database for cataloguing, rating and revewing music.

Unfortunately, as RYM/Sonemic does not have an API and excessive scraping can cause an IP ban, the functionalities of these tools will be pretty limited. Not much I can do about that. 

## What is Tampermonkey?
http://www.tampermonkey.net

Tampermonkey is a plugin created by Jan Biniok that allows users to add scripts in order to modify the functionality of websites. It's available for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge and Safari. 

From the plugin website:

"For example, with Tampermonkey, you could add a new button to a web page that lets you quickly share a link on social media, or to automatically fill in a form with your personal information. "
## Current Tools

- **wishlist-random-picker** Adds a tab on top of your wishlist that allows you to pick a random release from the current page. Useful for deciding what to listen to.

### Under Development

- **ratings-decade-sorter** Will sort all the ratings on the current page according to their decade. 
## New Features & Bugs
Suggestions for new features and bug reports are very appreciated! Please post them in the Issues tab. You don't have to have a knowledge of a programming in order to create a Github account, though you're very welcome to contribute to the code and improve the tools anyway you can.
